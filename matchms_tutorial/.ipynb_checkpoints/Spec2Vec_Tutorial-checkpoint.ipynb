    "This example in figure 3 looks already quiet promising and all selected candidates clearly show chemical similarities! But this is of course just one mostly random pick out of many spectra. In our Spec2Vec paper we compared the different similarity scores (Cosine, modified Cosine, Spec2Vec) in much more detail and found that Spec2Vec often — but not always — outperformed the classical scores. We also found a general trend that such scores are generally more reliable for larger compounds, supposedly because those will come with a higher number of chemically meaningful fragments."
